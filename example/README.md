# Simple example

Few notes:

- this example assumes you'll end up with a `cache.js` file in a `dist` folder
- this should have a tsconfig.json and build mechanism (unless you want to use raw JS), which is entirely omitted from this directory
- as mentioned in the root README, you'll need to copy paste src/types.ts file yourself to make use of `CacheGetter`
